  <h1>Why Soulful Eatery?</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing up as an African American woman, I thought that taking lots of medications was just apart of getting older. I remember seeing my mother and father struggle with their weight and always having bad news to report when going to the doctors office. Both of my parents suffered from high cholesterol and high blood pressure. I tried so hard to get them to eat healthier, but nothing seemed to work. It was only until they cut red meats out of their diets that we finally saw some improvement with their health.</p>
  <h1>What are the facts?</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>"African Americans have the highest coranary heart disease mortality rate of any ethnic group in the United States" (National Library of Medicine)</li>
      <li>"Among non-Hispanic blacks age 20 and older, 69% of men and 82% of women are overweight or obese" (American Heart Association)</li>
      <li>"Heart disease is the No.1 killer for all Americans"(American Heart Association)</li>
    </ul>
  <h1>What can we do to lower our risk of heart disease?</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Avoid Red Meats</li>
    <p>Harvard Medical School recommends a 3 ounce portion size when eating red meat and sticking to leaner cuts (Harvard Health Publishing).</p>
    <li>Limit Baked Goods</li>
    <p>We all love going to Crumbl cookies and trying out their weekly selection of sweets, but think about how much butter goes into each cookie. Butter and shortening may taste delicious, but it makes the cookies high in cholesterol.</p>
