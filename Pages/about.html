  <h1>Why Pescatarian?</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing up as an African American woman, I thought that taking lots of medications was just apart of getting older. I remember seeing my mother and father struggle with their weight and always having bad news to report when going to the doctors office. Both of my parents suffered from high cholesterol and high blood pressure. I tried so hard to get them to eat healthier, but nothing seemed to work. It was only until they cut red meats out of their diets that we finally saw some improvement with their health.</p>
  <h1>What are the facts?</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>"African Americans have the highest coranary heart disease mortality rate of any ethnic group in the United States" (National Library of Medicine)</li>
      <li>"Among non-Hispanic blacks age 20 and older, 69% of men and 82% of women are overweight or obese" (American Heart Association)</li>
